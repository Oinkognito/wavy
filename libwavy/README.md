# **libwavy**

This is the header library `libwavy`. All the implementation and logic behind "Wavy" as a concept is here.

## Notes 

When creating new headers ensure that you follow the code of conduct.

Also:

1. **ALWAYS ADD LOGGING!** (check out [logging](https://github.com/oinkognito/wavy/blob/main/libwavy/LOGGING.md) for more)
2. **FORMAT AND TIDY YOUR CODE!**
3. **ADD AMPLE DOCS!** (Not AI slop, just your logic and intention is enough)
4. **ONE FUNCTION, ONE TASK!** (This is more of an highly recommended advice than a mandation)
5. **TEST YOUR CODE!** (until GTest is integrated properly with wavy, ensure that you do multiple sanity checks locally before committing)

Although `libwavy` is still in its infancy, would appreciate any and all forms of contribution! (as long as they are not useless)
